"Distinct Accident Count for Accident, Person, Vehicle, Accident_Event, Accident_Location, Atmospheric_Cond, Road_Surface_Cond are expected to be the same. SubDCA is expected less as not all DCA code required subdca coded. Node is expected less as not all crashes could be geo located successfully. Node ID Complex Intersection ID is also expected less as it is only applicable to intersections classified as complex intersection. "

"Distinct Node ID Count for Accident, Accident_Location are expected to be the same. Node ID with negative values denote crashes can't be geo located, hence NODE is expected to be fewer lower. Accident Chainage is also expected less as some crashes can be geo located to an area but not road segment. Node ID Complex Intersection ID is also expected less as it is only applicable to intersections classified as complex intersection. "
